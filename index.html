  <h2 style="color: grey;">WHAT ARE BLACK HOLES?</h2>
  <div class="text"><p>Black holes are an area in space where the gravitational force is so strong that not even light can escape from it. It occurs when a massive star dies and its core collapses inwards, forming an incredibly dense and small point at the center of the black hole, known as the singularity. The point of no return, where anything that crosses it gets pulled towards the singularity, is called the event horizon. Although black holes cannot be directly observed, scientists can study their effects on the surrounding matter to learn more about their properties.</p></div>

  <h2 style="color: grey;">SIZE OF A BLACK HOLE</h2>
  <div class="text"><p>Black holes come in various sizes, ranging from the tiniest to the most massive. According to scientists, the smallest black holes are as small as a single atom, yet they possess the mass of a large mountain. The mass of an object refers to the amount of matter it contains.<a href="https://stsci-opo.org/STScI-01FMN37V4VGHDJBNEJYZ5RAY70.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://stsci-opo.org/STScI-01FMN37V4VGHDJBNEJYZ5RAY70.jpg" alt = 'Supermassive Black Hole'></a></p><p>Another type of black hole is called the "stellar" black hole, which can have a mass of up to 20 times that of the sun. There could be numerous stellar mass black holes in the Milky Way galaxy, which is the galaxy where Earth is located.</p><p>The largest type of black hole is known as "supermassive." These black holes are enormous and have a mass greater than 1 million suns combined. Researchers have evidence that every massive galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. For example, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, called <a style="color: red; text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*">Sagittarius A</a>, has a mass equivalent to about 4 million suns and could fit inside a colossal sphere that could accommodate a few million Earths.</p></div>

  <h2 style="color: grey;">HOW ARE THEY FORMED?</h2>
  <div class="text"><p>According to scientific theories, the tiniest black holes formed during the early stages of the universe's evolution.</p><p>Stellar black holes, on the other hand, are produced by the inward collapse of the central region of a massive star, which leads to a supernova explosion that ejects some of the star's material into space.</p><p>As for supermassive black holes, scientists believe that they were formed concurrently with the galaxy they reside in, as these black holes have a strong connection with the galaxy's evolution. However, the precise process by which these enormous black holes form is still not fully understood and is the subject of ongoing research.</p></div>

  <h2 style="color: grey;">HOW ARE THEY SEEN?</h2>
  <div class="text"><p>Black holes are invisible due to their intense gravitational pull, which attracts all light and matter in the vicinity. Nonetheless, scientists can indirectly observe their presence by analyzing the effects of their gravitational force on surrounding stars and gases. By examining the movement and orbits of stars in a particular region, scientists can deduce the existence of a black hole.</p><p>Furthermore, when a star approaches a black hole, the intense gravitational forces generate high-energy radiation that is invisible to the naked eye. To detect such radiation, scientists utilize advanced technologies such as telescopes and satellites in space. By studying these emissions, scientists can gather valuable insights into the properties and behavior of black holes.</p></div>

  <h2 style="color: grey;">SOUND FROM A BLACK HOLE</h2>
  <div class="text"><p>Black holes themselves do not produce any sound waves because they are regions in space where the gravitational force is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape their pull. Therefore, there is no physical matter that can vibrate or produce sound within the black hole. However, black holes can generate sound waves in their environment by affecting the surrounding matter. When matter falls into a black hole, it is accelerated to extreme speeds and heated up to high temperatures, which causes it to emit radiation in various forms, including X-rays and gamma rays. This radiation can cause the surrounding gas to vibrate and generate sound waves, which can be detected by instruments and telescopes on Earth. These sound waves are not audible to humans, as they are in the form of extremely low-frequency gravitational waves, which can only be detected by specialized equipment such as the <a style="color: red;text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)</a>. Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime itself, and they are generated by the acceleration of massive objects, such as black holes, in a process known as mergers. These mergers can produce intense gravitational waves that can be detected by LIGO and other similar instruments. Below is the sound from a supermassive black hole as caught by NASA.</div>
